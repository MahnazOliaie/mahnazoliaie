        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>I am currently a PhD candidate in Finance at Brunel University London, Department of Economics and Finance, researching the effects of Quantitative Easing on the cost of issuing UK government debt, bid-to-cover ratios at debt auctions, and the integration of UK capital markets under the supervision of Professor James Steeley.</p>
        
        <p>My research interests lie in financial market stability, market microstructure, sovereign debt markets, financial market integration, monetary policy transmission, and safe-haven dynamics.</p>
        
        <p>Alongside my research, I have experience as a Visiting Lecturer and Teaching Assistant at Brunel University London, where I have taught courses such as Corporate Finance and Corporate Investment. Additionally, I have assisted Master's students with research methodology, advanced econometric software training, and data analysis.</p>
